Took CSS and HTML structure from a Javascript calculator tutorial found on freshman.tech. Followed the steps in the calculator program to implement the given operators,
then further modified the code to add an additional two operators along with changes to the calculator formatting. 

From this app, we learned the basics of Javascript, CSS and HTML.
